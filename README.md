# Guts-DotNetEssentials
In this repository you can find start (visual studio) solutions for the exercises of the **.NET Essentials** course of **PXL-IT**.

The exercises are grouped by chapter. There is a (visual studio) solution for each chapter.
A chapter solution contains multiple projects:
- A WPF project for each exercise. E.g. *Exercise01*
- A test project for each WPF project. E.g. *Exercise01.Tests*

The WPF solutions are empty and waiting for you to complete them.
The matching test projects contain automated tests that can be run to check if your solution is correct.
